Install dependencies with:
composer install

Configure the database in the .env file

Run migrations:
php artisan migrate --seed

Open the project in the browser, it only has the main page, requests are done with AngularJS.


I used minimal Bootstrap and AngularJS on the front-end, Laravel and MySQL on the back-end.

I didn't use unit or functional testing professionally but I wrote some tests for the json api routes.
They are in tests/CrudTest.php
You car run them from the root folder using:
phpunit
